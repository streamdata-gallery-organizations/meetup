      summary: WebSockets Event Comments Stream
      description: |-
        For browsers that support it, [WebSockets](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/) is a more
        efficient alternative to the long-polling stream. This is a **push only** endpoint and will discard
        any messages received from the client after the socket is open.

        Because browser support for WebSockets is limited, we recommend that you consume this stream
        through the [must.js](https://github.com/meetup/must.js#readme) client, which can fallback to long-polling.

      summary: WebSockets RSVP Stream
      description: |-
        For browsers that support it, [WebSockets](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/) is a more
        efficient alternative to the long-polling stream. This is a **push only** endpoint and will discard
        any messages received from the client after the socket is open.

        Because browser support for WebSockets is limited, we recommend that you consume this stream
        through the [must.js](https://github.com/meetup/must.js#readme) client, which can fallback to long-polling.
