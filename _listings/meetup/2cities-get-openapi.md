    Searches with a query return up to 10 cities matching the term, and can be sorted
    by size or distance to a given coordinate. 'smart' ordering can be used to return
    the match(es) with the highest member_count, unless a smaller size match exists
    nearby the given coordinates. Query searches are supported for country but not

      summary: Cities
      description: Returns Meetup cities. This method supports search by latitude/longitude/radius,
        by country/state, by query term/zip, or a combination of all of these. Location-only
        searches by lat and lon return all cities within a radius of the provided
        coordinates. Searches with a query return up to 10 cities matching the term,
        and can be sorted by size or distance to a given coordinate. 'smart' ordering
        can be used to return the match(es) with the highest member_count, unless
        a smaller size match exists nearby the given coordinates. Query searches are
        supported for country but not country and state
